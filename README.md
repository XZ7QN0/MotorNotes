## Overview
### Description
Keep track of all your car related needs, from keeping track of mileage to tracking fuel costs and repairs, MotorNotes will help you keep track of your vehicle’s health.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Utility
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile users, but would perhaps be viable as a web application that users can access online.
- **Story:** Records information on service records, fuel records, and general information about the vehicle.
- **Market:** Anyone that owns a vehicle could use this app to keep track of their car’s maintenance status and overall health.
- **Habit:** This app would be used occasionally, as the user sees fit. For instance, the user can use this app when filling up on gas and after they receive their vehicle from a car shop.
- **Scope:** Our app would first show the user how to work with the application and how to record information for their vehicle. This application could evolve to giving users useful information, such as affordable gas stations near their location.
